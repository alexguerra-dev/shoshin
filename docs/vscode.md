# VSCode Guide

I added this to my `keybindings.json` file.

```json
{
  "key": "a",
  "command": "explorer.newFile",
  "when": "explorerViewletFocus && !inputFocus"
}
`k``

This did not work as _expected_ it still uses the `a` key when I am typing in a file name as the key to make a new file. I feel like that is something that can be fixed with a conditional statement. But, I am not sure how to do that. It might be a good thing to ask the AI about.

Now, when I am _focused_ on the explorer I can make a new file with the `a` key.

## Navigating Windows

I can use `ctrl + tab` to do some movement. I am not sure if that is the best way to do it.
