## Project

Shoshin is a personal project to help me learn _Javascript_ and _React_. I am using this project to learn how to use _Vercel_ and _Github_.
I am also using this project to learn how to use _Tailwind CSS_ and _Typescript_.

## Goals

- Learn _Javascript_ and _React_
- Learn _Vercel_ and _Github_
- Learn _Tailwind CSS_ and _Typescript_
- Setup all my tools

## Tasks

- [x] Make github repo
- [x] Make Vercel project
  - [ ] Make first push
  - [ ] Add custom domain
- [ ] Start documentation
- [ ] Setup tooling
- [ ] Setup debugger

  - [ ] Setup _Vim_ keybindings
  - [ ] Choose a font
    - [ ] Turn on ligatures
  - [ ] Setup Prettier
  - [ ] Setup Vim Extension
  - [ ] Choose a theme

- [ ] Watch Youtube videos on _Javascript_

I think I have chosen the theme I want for now. But, I do want to make one that is lite. Kind of like a notebook.
Added _auto import_, _auto rename tag_, _auto close tag_, and _auto complete tag_ to the vscode profile.
